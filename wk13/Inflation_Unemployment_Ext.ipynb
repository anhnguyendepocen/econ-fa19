    "While five-digit, Venezuelan-grade inflation is destructive, a little bit greases the wheels of commerce. It makes it easier for companies to give stealth pay cuts to underperformers, because keeping their pay flat is tantamount to a reduction in real wages. Some inflation is also useful to central banks because it helps them fight recessions. To spur borrowing, they like to cut their policy rates to well below the rate of inflation. But they have no room to do so if the rate is barely above zero. A surprise decline in inflation also punishes borrowers by making their debts more burdensome. \n",

This scenario, of course, directly contradicts the theory behind the Philips curve. The United States never experienced stagflation until the 1970s, when rising unemployment did not coincide with declining inflation. \n",

    "* One theory states that this economic phenomenon is caused when a sudden increase in the cost of oil reduces an economy's productive capacity. In October 1973, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) issued an embargo against Western countries. This caused the global price of oil to rise dramatically, therefore increasing the costs of goods and contributing to a rise in unemployment. Because transportation costs rise, producing products and getting them to shelves got more expensive and prices rose even as people got laid off. \n",
    "* Harsh regulation of markets, goods and labor in an otherwise inflationary environment are cited as the possible cause of stagflation.\n",
    "* Removing last vestiges of the gold standard -  this removed commodity backing for the currency and put the U.S. dollar and most other world currencies on fiat basis ever since then, ending most practical constraint on the monetary expansion and currency devaluation. \n",
